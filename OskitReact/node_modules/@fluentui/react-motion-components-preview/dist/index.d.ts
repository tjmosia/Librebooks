/**
 * This is a factory function that generates a motion function, which has variant params bound into it.
 * The generated motion function accepts other runtime params that aren't locked into the variant, but supplied at runtime.
 * This separation allows the variant to be defined once and reused with different runtime params which may be orthogonal to the variant params.
 * For example, a variant may define the duration and easing of a transition, which are fixed for all instances of the variant,
 * while the runtime params may give access to the target element, which is different for each instance.
 *
 * The generated motion function is also framework-independent, i.e. non-React.
 * It can be turned into a React component using `createPresenceComponent`.
